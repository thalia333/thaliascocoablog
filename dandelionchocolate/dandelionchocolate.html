            <p>
            When I went to Dandelion Chocolate on a sunny Saturday afternoon, 
            Valencia Street was bustling and thrumming with spring energy. Inside, 
            the intimate store was crowded with people sitting and enjoying their 
            drinks and browsing through the offerings of different chocolate products. 
            There were three different hot chocolate types: regular, Mission style, 
            and European sipping chocolate. I opted for <span class="highlight">the Mission,</span> which has a special 
            flavor twist of cinnamon, cayenne, and chili. I waited in line for my hot 
            chocolate for about five minutes, but the store was well equipped for lines 
            by placing <span class="highlight">chocolate samples</span> along the wall to taste as you waited.

        <p id="secondtext"> The hot chocolate ranged from <span class="highlighttwo">$5.25-$8,</span> depending on what size you order. 
            I suggest getting a small size because it is so rich that getting a large size
            might give you a tummy ache. My drink was ready within a couple of minutes and
            I decided to drink it outside in their cute outdoor seating. It was obvious to
            me that Dandelion Chocolate cares about their presentation because it serves 
            its drinks in innovative to-go cups that have a small, delicious cookie in a 
            carrier on the side. Bonus points for packaging and <span class="highlighttwo">brand identity!</span>

        <p id="thirdtext"> 
            The hot chocolate was perfectly <span class="highlight">rich</span>  and creamy, without being too thick or sweet. 
            I could feel the <span class="highlight">spice</span> tingling in my tongue and throat, enough to be satisfying 
            without traumatizing any customers. It’s obvious that they take their chocolate 
            seriously as some of the notes of the cocoa came through even though it was not 
            raw chocolate. I was very pleased with my drink and find it perfect for anyone who’s 
            looking for a <span class="highlight">gourmet</span> hot chocolate or cocoa with a little extra flair and finesse. 
            Bonus points for cute baristas!
